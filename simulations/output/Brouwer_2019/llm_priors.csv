None,Predictors of Relapse in Major Depressive Disorder: A Longitudinal Study,"This longitudinal study examines the factors predicting relapse and recurrence in individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Using clinical interviews, participants were assessed for their MDD status, remission periods, and relapse occurrences. The study applies leading psychological theories to identify predictors measured prior to relapse, providing robust data for effect size calculations. Results indicate significant predictors that may inform interventions for preventing MDD relapse.",1,"The study meets all inclusion criteria, including diagnostic status of MDD, assessment of remission, longitudinal design, and theoretical basis for predictors."
None,Examining Depression in Older Adults: A Focus on Etiology and Treatment,"This study explores the prevalence and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in older adults, specifically examining those with first onset MDD under the age of 65. It investigates various treatment modalities and their effectiveness, while also considering the influence of different comorbid conditions. The findings aim to provide insights into the unique aspects of MDD in younger populations compared to late-life onset cases.",0,"The study includes individuals with first onset MDD under the age of 65, which does not align with the exclusion criteria of the review focusing on those over 65."
