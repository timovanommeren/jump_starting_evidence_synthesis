None,Therapeutic Outcomes in Wilson Disease: A Comparative Study of Established Treatments,"This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of four established therapies for Wilson disease: D-penicillamine, trientine, etrathiomolybdate, and zinc salts. We conducted a comparative analysis of these treatments in patients of various ages and stages of the disease. Key outcomes assessed include all-cause mortality, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), neurological symptoms, liver-related complications, adverse effects, and treatment discontinuation rates. Data were collected from both prospective and retrospective studies published in multiple languages, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic strategies.",1,"The abstract describes a study that evaluates the effects of established therapies for Wilson disease, aligning perfectly with the inclusion criteria regarding outcomes and study design."
None,Comparison of Zinc Salts in Clinical Trials,"This study investigates the efficacy of two different dosages of zinc salts (50 mg vs 100 mg) in a clinical trial setting. The results indicate that there may be variations in patient outcomes based on dosage, but further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.",0,"The study involves a comparison of zinc salt dosages, which does not fit the inclusion criteria that allow only placebo comparisons or treatments excluding the respective study drug. Also, it is a non-controlled study, which is excluded."
